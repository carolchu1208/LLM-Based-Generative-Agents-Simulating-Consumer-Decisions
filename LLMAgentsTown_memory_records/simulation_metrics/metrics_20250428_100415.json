It's one of my favorite comfort foods, and it'll give me the energy I need to tackle whatever comes next.\n\nAs I wait for my food to arrive, I take a few deep breaths and try to unwind. I've been feeling the stress of working in Pine Grove Houses all day, and I'm looking forward to some quiet time at home."
