I'm feeling a bit peckish after a light snack earlier, so I'll make sure to stop by the Fried Chicken Shop on my way out of the Oak View Condos. A hearty meal will give me the energy I need for a productive day.\n\nI quickly head out of my residence and make my way to the Fried Chicken Shop. As I walk in, the aroma of crispy fried chicken hits me, and my stomach growls in anticipation. I order myself a filling breakfast combo, complete with scrambled eggs, bacon, and a side of hash browns.
