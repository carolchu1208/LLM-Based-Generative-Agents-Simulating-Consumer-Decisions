You seem a bit antsy," I say with a friendly smile.\n\nI ask her if she\'d like to grab some food together, perhaps something with the discounted meal deal. This way, we can both take advantage of the offer and catch up while doing so.'}, {'speaker': 'John Smith', 'listener': 'self', 'location': 'Fried Chicken Shop', 'time': '12:03', 'content': "I'll visit the local establishments.
