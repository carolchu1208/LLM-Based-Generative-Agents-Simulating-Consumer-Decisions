# ‚öôÔ∏è Critical System Parameters

> **‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING**: These parameters are **calibrated** to match paper results. Modifying them may cause agent starvation, simulation failure, or inability to reproduce research findings.

## üîã Energy System Constants

All energy constants are defined in `simulation_constants.py`.

### Energy Thresholds
```python
ENERGY_MAX = 100                    # Maximum agent energy
ENERGY_MIN = 0                      # Minimum agent energy
ENERGY_THRESHOLD_LOW = 20           # üö® Critical: Triggers food-seeking behavior
ENERGY_THRESHOLD_FOOD = 25          # Preventive food planning threshold
```

### Energy Decay Rates (per simulation hour)
```python
ENERGY_DECAY_PER_HOUR = 5          # üö® Critical: Base energy loss rate
ENERGY_COST_WORK_HOUR = 5          # Energy cost during work hours
ENERGY_COST_PER_STEP = 1           # Energy cost per movement step
ENERGY_COST_PER_HOUR_IDLE = 1      # Energy cost while idle
```

### Energy Recovery Rates
```python
ENERGY_GAIN_RESTAURANT_MEAL = 45    # üö® Critical: Restaurant meal recovery
ENERGY_GAIN_HOME_MEAL = 25          # Home cooking recovery
ENERGY_GAIN_SNACK = 10             # Snack energy gain
ENERGY_GAIN_NAP = 15               # Nap recovery during work hours (11:00-15:00)
ENERGY_GAIN_CONVERSATION = 5        # Social interaction energy gain
```

### Sleep System
- **Hours**: 23:00-06:00 (automatic)
- **Mechanism**: Sets energy to `ENERGY_MAX` (100) every hour
- **Purpose**: Compensates for natural decay, prevents starvation
- **Note**: Sleep does NOT add energy, it SETS energy to maximum

## üçΩÔ∏è Menu Configuration

Restaurant menus are defined in `agent_configuration.json` under `town_areas.dining`.

### Menu Structure
Each restaurant must include:
```json
{
  "menu": {
    "breakfast": {
      "available_hours": [7, 8, 9],
      "item": "Item Name",
      "base_price": 15.0
    },
    "lunch": { ... },
    "dinner": { ... },
    "snack": { ... }
  },
  "discount": {
    "type": "percentage",
    "value": 20,
    "days": [3, 4]
  }
}
```

### Critical Parameters
- **Fried Chicken Shop Discount**: 20% on Days 3-4 (DO NOT MODIFY)
- **Available Hours**: Must match meal_type expectations
- **Base Prices**: Calibrated for agent income levels

### Energy-Meal Type Mapping
```python
# Defined in simulation_execution_classes.py
meal_type == "breakfast" ‚Üí ENERGY_GAIN_RESTAURANT_MEAL (45)
meal_type == "lunch"     ‚Üí ENERGY_GAIN_RESTAURANT_MEAL (45)
meal_type == "dinner"    ‚Üí ENERGY_GAIN_RESTAURANT_MEAL (45)
meal_type == "snack"     ‚Üí ENERGY_GAIN_SNACK (10)
home cooking             ‚Üí ENERGY_GAIN_HOME_MEAL (25)
```

## üèôÔ∏è Town Map & Locations

Town layout is defined in `agent_configuration.json` under `town_areas`.

### Location Categories
1. **Dining**: Fried Chicken Shop, Local Diner, Coffee Shop
2. **Retail & Grocery**: Local Market, Convenience Store
3. **Workplace**: Various offices and restaurants
4. **Leisure**: Park, Community Center
5. **Residential**: Individual homes for each agent

### Coordinate System
- Grid-based (x, y) coordinates
- Travel cost: 1 energy per step moved
- Agents can complete entire path in one simulation hour
- Distance affects energy cost but not time

## üéØ Simulation Parameters

### Time System
```python
SIMULATION_START_DAY = 1           # Start day
SIMULATION_DAYS = 7                # Total simulation days
SIMULATION_START_HOUR = 7          # Start at 7:00 AM
SIMULATION_END_HOUR = 23           # End at 11:00 PM
```

### Money System
```python
STARTING_MONEY = 1000              # Initial agent money
GROCERY_COST_HOME_MEAL = 10        # Cost to cook at home
# Individual meal prices defined in menu configuration
```

### Work Hours
- Standard: 9:00-17:00
- Income earned based on hourly_wage from agent config
- Energy cost: 5 per hour worked

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Mechanisms

### Menu Validation (`menu_validator.py`)
- Validates all agent food requests against actual restaurant menus
- Provides emergency food alternatives when requests fail
- Logs invalid requests for debugging
- Prevents agent starvation from LLM hallucination

### Energy Recovery System
- **Emergency Detection**: When agent energy < 20
- **Automatic Return**: When agent energy ‚â§ 0, forced return to residence
- **Sleep Enforcement**: Automatic sleep during 23:00-06:00 with forced home travel
- **Nap Availability**: During work hours (11:00-15:00) at workplace

### Location Validation
- All locations dynamically loaded from `agent_configuration.json`
- Prompts include only valid locations
- Invalid location requests logged and rejected

## üìä Expected System Behavior

### Daily Energy Cycle (Example)
```
Hour 7:  100 energy (wake from sleep)
Hour 8:  95 (travel: -1, decay: -5, breakfast: +45, net: -5)
Hour 9:  85 (work: -5, decay: -5)
Hour 12: 70 (continue work + decay)
Hour 13: 110 ‚Üí 100 (lunch: +45, capped at max)
Hour 17: 80 (end work)
Hour 19: 95 (dinner: +45, decay: -5)
Hour 23: 100 (automatic sleep sets to max)
```

### Revenue Impact (Days 2‚Üí3 with discount)
- Fried Chicken Shop: ~51% revenue increase
- Market Share: 30% ‚Üí 41%
- Local Diner: 62% ‚Üí 48% (substitution effect)

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Agent Death / Starvation
**Symptoms**: Agent energy reaches 0, simulation fails
**Causes**:
- Energy decay too high
- Meal recovery too low
- Sleep not restoring properly
- Agents not eating due to LLM hallucination

**Solutions**:
1. Verify `ENERGY_DECAY_PER_HOUR = 5` in `simulation_constants.py`
2. Check sleep system sets energy to 100 (not adds to current)
3. Review `menu_validator.py` logs for failed food requests
4. Ensure `ENERGY_GAIN_RESTAURANT_MEAL = 45`

### LLM Hallucination
**Symptoms**: Agents request non-existent food or locations
**Causes**:
- LLM generating creative but invalid responses
- Prompts not constraining to valid options

**Solutions**:
1. Check `menu_validator.py` is catching invalid requests
2. Review `prompt_manager.py` includes valid location lists
3. Monitor logs for validation warnings
4. Use fallback responses when needed

### Revenue Anomalies
**Symptoms**: Restaurant revenue doesn't match expected patterns
**Causes**:
- Discount not applied correctly
- Agents avoiding restaurants due to energy issues
- Menu pricing misconfigurations

**Solutions**:
1. Verify discount days in `agent_configuration.json`
2. Check agent energy levels are healthy (>30 average)
3. Review `simulation_metrics/` for dining patterns
4. Confirm menu prices match configuration

## üìû Support

If parameters need adjustment for your research:
1. Document current values before changes
2. Test with short simulations (1-2 days) first
3. Monitor agent energy levels in logs
4. Review `LLMAgentsTown_memory_records/` for behavior changes
5. Restore original values if simulation becomes unstable

**Remember**: These parameters were calibrated through extensive testing to balance realism, agent survival, and paper reproducibility.
