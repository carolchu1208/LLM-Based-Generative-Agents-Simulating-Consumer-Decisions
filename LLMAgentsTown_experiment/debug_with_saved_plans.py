"""
Debug script to run simulation with saved plans from previous runs.

This script allows you to:
1. Skip LLM plan generation (saves time)
2. Use exact same plans from your last run 
3. Test your updated functions quickly
4. See if your fixes work with the same scenarios

Usage:
1. Run normal simulation until you want to interrupt (Ctrl+C)
2. Plans will be automatically saved via MemoryManager
3. Run this script to reuse those plans and test your changes

Note: All plan management is now handled by MemoryManager for consistency
with other data persistence (memories, conversations, etc.)
